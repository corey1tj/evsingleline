## Key Notes

1. **Input currents are manufacturer-rated** values from the FutureEnergy install manual (Tables 9-10, 9-11), not efficiency-calculated estimates.

2. **NEC Minimum vs. Manufacturer Recommendation:** The NEC minimum breaker satisfies code per Article 625 continuous load sizing (125%). Manufacturer-recommended breakers provide additional headroom for thermal derating, transient peaks, and real-world operating conditions.

3. **Per NEC 110.3(B):** Equipment must be installed per manufacturer instructions. If the installation guide specifies a larger breaker, the AHJ may require it.

4. **Conductor sizing** is based on NEC Table 310.16 at 75°C copper termination rating (THWN-2). Actual sizing must account for ambient temperature correction (Table 310.15(B)(1)), conduit fill adjustment (Table 310.15(C)(1)), and voltage drop for long runs (recommend ≤3%).

5. **All DCFC models are dual-connector** with power sharing. Total input draw stays at the rated current; DC output splits between vehicles when both connectors are active.

6. **Max input wire size:** 250 kcmil × 2 per manufacturer spec (Table 9-13).

7. **For multi-charger installations,** load management systems can reduce total service requirements. Consult with the CSMS vendor and electrical engineer for coordinated load calculations.

8. **Always verify utility service availability** and transformer capacity before committing to a charger power level. Utility lead times for service upgrades can be 6–18+ months.

Future Energy DC/180 - From a strict NEC minimum standpoint, a 300 A breaker can be considered code compliant. At 480 V three-phase, the charger’s nominal input current is roughly 216–225 A depending on efficiency and power factor. Because EVSE is treated as a continuous load under NEC Article 625, the overcurrent protective device must be sized at 125% of the continuous load. 
225 A × 125% ≈ 281 A
The next standard breaker size per NEC 240.6 would be 300 A, which satisfies the minimum code requirement when conductors, terminals, and temperature ratings are properly coordinated. That said, the 400 A breaker listed in the installation guide is a manufacturer's recommendation rather than the NEC minimum, and it is intentional. The reasoning behind the 400 A recommendation is based on real-world operating conditions and reliability considerations, including: DC fast chargers do not draw perfectly flat current. There are short-duration current peaks during startup, DC bus pre-charge, and dynamic load changes driven by the vehicle BMS. A 300 A breaker can be very close to its thermal limit under these conditions. Internal losses and efficiency also play a role. Actual input current is influenced by rectifier efficiency, power factor correction behavior, and auxiliary loads, which can push real input current higher than simple nameplate calculations suggest. Ambient temperature, enclosure heating, elevation, conductor bundling, and terminal temperature ratings all introduce derating in the field. A breaker that is technically code-compliant on paper can experience nuisance tripping once these factors are stacked. From a system and uptime perspective, the additional headroom provided by a 400 A breaker significantly reduces the risk of nuisance trips during sustained high-power operation, which directly impacts customer experience and service calls.
For AHJ and customer discussions, a good way to frame this is:
The NEC minimum breaker size for this charger can be as low as 300 A based on continuous load calculations. However, Autel recommends a 400 A breaker to provide operating margin for thermal conditions, efficiency losses, and transient current peaks, and to ensure reliable full-power operation. Manufacturer installation instructions must be followed per NEC 110.3(B). In summary, 300-amp breakers are acceptable but have limited head room. 400 amp provides increased head room and takes into consideration additional factors like ambient temp corrections and voltage drops based on the length of the run.
